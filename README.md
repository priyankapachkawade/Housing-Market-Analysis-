## 1. Project Title

**Housing Market Analysis Project**

## 2. Project Description

### Overview

This project is a Python-based analysis of a housing dataset, focusing on understanding the distribution of houses across neighborhoods, the age of houses, and sale prices. The project aims to extract meaningful insights that can help in understanding the housing market trends.

### Motivation

This project was created to apply data analysis techniques to real-world data and extract insights that could be useful for potential homebuyers, real estate investors, or policymakers. The significance lies in its ability to identify trends and outliers in the housing market, aiding in better decision-making.

### Features
